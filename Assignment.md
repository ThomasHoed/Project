### Problem statement


Write a statement about the problem that your finished project will solve. The problem has to be clearly described and very specific. We see two possibilities:

There is a clearly defined problem that a reasonably large group of people have, which an app or visualization can solve particularly well.
There is a widespread lack of knowledge or understanding that an interactive visualization is particularly suited to remedy.

In both cases, you should be able to define a target audience who have specific interests that match your project. Include that, too.

In total, keep the problem statement to four or five lines of text.

### Solution

Describe your solution in full detail.

Summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to the “gap” that you describe.

Include a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat!

Include a list of main features that will be available to users. All features should also be visible in the sketch. Keep it brief.

Split the features into 1) the minimum viable product (MVP) and 2) parts that are optional to implement.

A minimum viable product is the product with as least features as possible, which still helps solve the problem for your target audience. We think it’s important to clearly define this, because it defines the minimum amount of work that you will have to put into the project.

Other parts of your project may be optional to implement or “nice to have”.

### Prerequisites

Describe the things that you’ll have to get in order.

List the data sources that you will use and whether you will need to transform the data before it is usable for your application. The list should include links to where the data sources can be downloaded or accessed.

List the external components (libraries like d3-tip or SQLite) that you need to implement certain features. Include the names, and if the component is not standard, include a link to its website.

Include a review of similar mobile apps or related visualizations, in terms of features and technical aspects: what do they do? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way?

Identify the hardest parts of implementing your application: think of technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these.

### Sanity check

Before continuing, compare your solution to the project requirements one last time. Also, is it still clear that your proposed project is indeed a solution to the stated problem?

Also, the proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

Finally, make sure that your document is spell-checked, and that images are not too large or too small (your document will be read in a normal browser via GitHub).
